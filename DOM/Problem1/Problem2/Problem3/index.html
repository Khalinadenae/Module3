Create an HTML page with a dropdown list with three items in it, then write a JavaScript function that displays the number of items and displays the item in the list when you select from the dropdown.

1. Google "html select onchange", which you can use to trigger your JavaScript function
2. You can add extra HTML elements, like a P element, that you can use JavaScript to display the values inside of.
3. So, you should create an HTML file with a dropdown.
4. When someone selects an item from the dropdown, it will run your JavaScript function that you'll write in your JavaScript file, will display the number of items and the list of items in the P elements you designate to display those items.
â€‹5. If you Google "javascript get options from select", here's the first link that pops up, click here.
6. If you read through that and go to the example of how to get the text value of each option, using the index (since the dropdown "options" will give you an array of all the options in your dropdown), you'll be able to use that logic to grab the text.
7. You can use a "for loop" to grab all the text values from the Select element, put them into an array, and turn that array of the values into a string to be displayed in your HTML.
